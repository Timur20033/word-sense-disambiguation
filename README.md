Word sense disambiguation algorithm for an english term "fold" in origami tessellation discourse is proposed. Main factors used in algorithm are frequency, part of speech, and distribution. As a result, average accuracy on test sample amounts to 72% (with range 50-100%). <br /><br />
annotation.py - code with the algorithm <br />
semantic_tags.json - all the tags used for sense disambiguation <br />
raw_corpus - repository from different websites where english origami tessellation terminology is performed <br />
test_sample - sample of 10 txt.files randomly extracted from the corpus <br />
annotated_sample - tested sample with semantic annotation <br />
accuracy_evaluation.txt - percents of accuracy in sample and in total <br />
