Model folded from a sheet of decorated Washi I received courtesy of Satoko Saito.
In other words, a non-traditional approach to origami is required when trying to fold origami fractals.
When I see something to the effect of “can you believe it’s just folded paper” I think why shouldn’t it be folded paper?
I was wondering if the book includes step-by-step instructions on how to fold all sorts of different tessellations, or are they just crease patterns?
While designers such as Yoshihide Momotani and Shuzo Fujimoto explored @tessellations early on, only recently did these folds become more main-stream.
The repeating 6-fold parts of the pattern are not aligned with a natural tiling break, so you must choose between aligning the closest repeats with the edge ( which means folding all the way to the edge) and aligning the tiling breaks with the edge (so you can leave a border).
This shape can’t be achieved starting directly from Red Flower, so now I think that Fujimoto did not publish John Lackland as a separate design, but must have arrived at it as an intermediate stage while folding that design.
Reverse Engineering Challenge Results
Thanks to everyone who folded the Herringbone Weave origami tessellation in the last two weeks!
So I picked up a piece of 8.5x11" sheet of printer paper, folded the diagonal, trimmed off the excess, and googled "fold a paper into 7ths" and went on.
Interestingly, I came up with it later than with Square Interlace Tessellation even though Propellers is one of the intermediate steps when folding Square Interlace.
