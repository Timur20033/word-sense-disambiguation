Almost all models folded are intermediate to complex 3D animals.
My wife had been experimenting with paper marbling and decided to try the technique on a piece that had already been folded rather than just a flat piece of paper.
The trial and error, combining and discarding various elements: eyes, noses, mouths, to see which fit and how the folds interact.
When fully compressed, the flasher becomes much smaller, with a small “bowl” in the center surrounded by thick walls made from folded layers of the remaining paper.
This paper is softer than the other ones, and I found that reversing a fold is a bit tedious.
However, adjusting a fold line makes it too weak, and slight pinches don't show – you must make sharp creases.
I love to see people folding grids - and the tessellations made with them!
This was the first time I folded Edokosome paper which I bought at CDO convention: have a look at the blog post with my review.
Many creases will align and can be folded in one stroke.
I plan to make another fold some time, with layers arranged horizontally rather than vertically.
