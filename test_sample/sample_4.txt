Adulthood (Ilan Garibi and Hagay Golan): Instructions

This video shows how to fold the origami tessellation "Adulthood" designed by Ilan Garibi and Hagay Golan.
Since it is quite difficult to make a perpendicular crease against 64 mountain fold lines, do not crease 64 horizontal creases and then rotate the paper to complete the perpendicular ones.
Clover Folding (22×22 grid)
I hadn’t folded Shuzo Fujimoto’s Clover Folding for at least two years when I decided to fold one again after seeing some examples beautifully folded by John McKeever.
Clover Folding
Along with the Hydrangea, this is one of the oldest picture of a tessellation folded by me (taken in June 2015).
The mask is symmetrical so I can use the information on the completed side to fold the rest of the mask.
We ended up folding a slightly different variant and only in the next morning did I remember how to fold the original.
The area below the intersection has spacings of 2, so I fold those in half again.
In this case, I fold the bottom line up to the intersection.
In the second image, you can take a peek at my design technique and see the stages a design like this goes through: first, the doodles of individual molecules, each folded from a test sheet with 16×16 grid, then planning for the layout of molecules and grid size (the final model ended up being from 64×16 grid), drawing the precrease pattern (PreCP), and the final work.
I had folded models for the new cover design of the copy paper packages.
