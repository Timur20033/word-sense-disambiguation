With around 80 GSM, the thickness of the paper is great for multi layers, and it's still easy to fold 3 and even 5 layers together as can be seen in my variation of the Pineapple tessellation.
Each molecule uses an 8×8 grid and in the folded model corresponds to one small square plus a one grid unit wide area around it.
Spinning Saws Origami Tessellation
Rotated grids are a powerful tool for folding display-ready tessellations.
But mostly I’ll be showing little ones how to fold paper and have fun.
That almost sounds like Inside reverse fold when I first started origami.Cool Awsome model though.

Time-Lapse: 1-Cube Exercise Tessellation (Alessandro Beber)
Paper used in this video: hexagon with a side length of 10.5 cm (4 1/8 in) and a diameter of 21 cm (8 1/4 in), kami
Finished model: hexagon with a side length of 5.25 cm (2 1/16 in) and a diameter of 10.5 cm (4 1/8 in)

This video shows how I fold a fantastic origami tessellation called "1-Cube Exercise" designed by Alessandro Beber.
At 35cm the details are nicely formed, although making the wing and reverse folding the legs was a little struggle.
With that I wish you happy folding and exploring the world of origami @tessellations!
You can see how the paper is folded into waves and is all one layer, especially when compared to the previous example.
It's strong, yet thin; it is stiff, yet folds easily; it has a beautiful palette of colors, and it comes in all the right sizes.
