I have questions concerning the folding of a mask.
Unfortunately, shortly after I took this picture, I discovered that I had made a small but crucial error in folding the bottom of the nose.
However, the twist fold used in tessellations is a new variant.
On the front you see the spaces between the folds as strips, and where they appear to weave is actually a twist fold seen from the back.
Cluster Tessellation
Cluster Tessellation, designed and folded by Michał Kosmulski.
But after it works surprisingly well if you actually fold something.
For this model there is a twist fold that requires a lot of bending resistance.
My first attempt at folding this model resulted in a slightly modified molecule and ended up being called Box with Woven Triangles XVI.
The repeating 6-fold parts of the pattern are not aligned with a natural tiling break, so you must choose between aligning the closest repeats with the edge ( which means folding all the way to the edge) and aligning the tiling breaks with the edge (so you can leave a border).
Then try folding these 10 tessellations following tutorials from other YouTubers!
