The opening weekend coincided with the Origami Festival, with activities, classes and demonstrations for devotees of the folding arts.
My main reason for folding this model, apart from it being a classic, is that I designed a pattern called Shifted Bricks which looks similar but has a different internal structure.
I’ve been working on this idea for some time — being able to fold a tessellation where the areas between molecules would be flat and “at the same level” as the tessellation molecules themselves (flagstone-style).
Sol (Kaiser/Stark paper)
Another clean fold of Sol, this time from Kaiser/Stark paper.
It might be possible with a larger sheet, and maybe I will try to make a clean fold some time later if time allows.
:D

Open Triangle Linked Flowers Origami Tessellation
When you put triangles next to hexagons you give yourself many, many options of what to fold next.
Just considering the time it takes to fold a piece when I know exactly what to do and I have a piece of paper that has been prefolded into a grid, may be a matter of say four or five hours.

Since I've gotten many questions on how to make more than 3 stages, I'll probably make a video showing how to do that.
Thanks to everyone who attended my workshops or just stopped by to chat or fold together.

How would you like to be able to fold tessellations like mine?
