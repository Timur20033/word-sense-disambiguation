Since it is quite difficult to make a perpendicular crease against 64 mountain fold lines, do not crease 64 horizontal creases and then rotate the paper to complete the perpendicular ones.
The tessellation molecule is folded from a 6×6 grid and there are 5×5 molecules in this model.
I folded this 3.5” floppy as a test of my newest idea in bitmap tessellations — the Square Interlace Bitmap Tessellation.
And that's exactly what I've been exploring with my Tessellations by Tiles students - how to fold in 20 tilings and what hidden depths are available in each.
Then try folding these 10 tessellations following tutorials from other YouTubers!
I’ve worked with over 60 different tilings and each one has its own folding characteristics.
While folding the grid, you can feel how sturdy the paper is.
Whirlwind Box (folded from full grid)
This Whirlwind Box is folded from a full 16×16 grid on copy paper.
The following video shows how to fold a long hexagon:
The following video shows how to fold a square spring:
We assembled our origami crafts to produce three prototype telescope models.
So, will you join me in folding some mini tessellations?
