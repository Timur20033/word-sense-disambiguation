Precreasing showed good results, the short fold[ADJ1] lines did not expand into the adjacent squares.
It's strong, yet thin; it is stiff, yet folds[VERB5] easily; it has a beautiful palette of colors, and it comes in all the right sizes.
The first big publication (in English) that demystified tessellations and explained how to fold[VERB5] several stunning projects was Origami @Tessellations by Eric Gjerde (also available at The Source).
Whirlwind Tessellation It took me a while between folding[VERB5] a box decorated with a single molecule and folding[VERB5] a complete tessellation.
They're also the level of analysis that's most beneficial for folding[VERB5] and designing.
I have never folded[VERB5] the entire shape from one sheet of paper without cutting, even for n=2.
I folded[VERB5] the closed version in the 7-stage fold,[NOUN1] and the open version in the 11-stage fold.[NOUN1]
)How are the twists connected - are all the pleats perpendicular to each other?This tessellation is an unusual example of the square tiling that has no rotational symmetry in its folded[VERB5] form, only translational symmetry.That said, these hybrid square twists have two possible folded[VERB5] states from the initial pleat positions and you could fold[ADJ3] a version of this tessellation with 2-fold[VERB5] rotational symmetry with a checkerboard pattern of the hybrid square squash directions on each side.How would you choose to this - with or without rotational symmetry?
Now, i have questions about the precreasing for the clover: - first, is it a standard precreasing technique, or do you use it for this precise project because the mountain and valley folds[VERB2] one obtains suit the necessary ones for the clover model?
Itâ€™s folded[VERB5] from a very large hexagon shaped piece of paper.
