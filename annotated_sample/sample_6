Almost all models folded[VERB5] are intermediate to complex 3D animals.
My wife had been experimenting with paper marbling and decided to try the technique on a piece that had already been folded[VERB5] rather than just a flat piece of paper.
The trial and error, combining and discarding various elements: eyes, noses, mouths, to see which fit and how the folds[NOUN1] interact.
When fully compressed, the flasher becomes much smaller, with a small “bowl” in the center surrounded by thick walls made from layers of the remaining paper.
This paper is softer than the other ones, and I found that reversing a fold[NOUN1] is a bit tedious.
However, adjusting a fold[ADJ1] line makes it too weak, and slight pinches don't show – you must make sharp creases.
I love to see people folding[VERB4] grids - and the tessellations made with them!
This was the first time I folded[VERB1] Edokosome paper which I bought at CDO convention: have a look at the blog post with my review.
Many creases will align and can be folded[VERB5] in one stroke.
I plan to make another fold[NOUN1] some time, with layers arranged horizontally rather than vertically.
