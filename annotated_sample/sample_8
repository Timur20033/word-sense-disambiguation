Model folded[VERB5] from a sheet of decorated Washi I received courtesy of Satoko Saito.
In other words, a non-traditional approach to origami is required when trying to fold[VERB5] origami fractals.
When I see something to the effect of “can you believe it’s just folded[VERB1] paper” I think why shouldn’t it be folded[VERB1] paper?
I was wondering if the book includes step-by-step instructions on how to fold[VERB5] all sorts of different tessellations, or are they just crease patterns?
While designers such as Yoshihide Momotani and Shuzo Fujimoto explored @tessellations early on, only recently did these folds[NOUN1] become more main-stream.
The repeating 6-fold[ADJ2] parts of the pattern are not aligned with a natural tiling break, so you must choose between aligning the closest repeats with the edge ( which means folding[VERB1] all the way to the edge) and aligning the tiling breaks with the edge (so you can leave a border).
This shape can’t be achieved starting directly from Red Flower, so now I think that Fujimoto did not publish John Lackland as a separate design, but must have arrived at it as an intermediate stage while folding[VERB5] that design.
Reverse Engineering Challenge Results Thanks to everyone who folded[VERB5] the Herringbone Weave origami tessellation in the last two weeks!
So I picked up a piece of 8.5x11" sheet of printer paper, folded[VERB1] the diagonal, trimmed off the excess, and googled "fold[VERB3] a paper into 7ths" and went on.
Interestingly, I came up with it later than with Square Interlace Tessellation even though Propellers is one of the intermediate steps when folding[VERB5] Square Interlace.
